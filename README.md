Project: Monte Carlo Simulator

# Synopsis

The Monte Carlo Simulator consists of three classes: **Die**, **Game**, and **Analyzer**, which allow the user to implement a simple [monte carlo simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). Game objects are initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with a Game object. A Die can be any discrete random variable associated with a stochastic process, such as using a deck of cards, flipping a coin, rolling an actual die, or speaking a language.

## Installing Monte Carlo Simulator

Download files from the project [github repository](https://github.com/jackburke12/ds5100_final_project.git).

```
pip install monte_carlo_simulator
```



# API Description




-   **Synopsis:** Show brief demo code of how the classes are used, i.e.
    code snippets showing how to install, import, and use the code
    to (1) create dice, (2) play a game, and (3) analyze a game. You can
    use preformatted blocks for the code.

-   **API description**: A list of all classes with their public methods
    and attributes. Each item should show their docstrings. All
    parameters (with data types and defaults) should be described. All
    return values should be described. Do not describe private methods
    and attributes.
